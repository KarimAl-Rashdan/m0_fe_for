# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel very confident.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It felt great that I was able to find my own answers. I had unproductive struggle when I forgot that my for expressions had to be separated by a semicolon not a comma. I had productive struggle when learning how to check the character length in an array.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I just want more practice with for statements in general which I will do during my independent study time.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I don't have any questions so far.
